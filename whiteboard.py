# Find Middle Number
# Given a number (n) and an array of numbers (num_list) as input to a function, 
# return True if the number is greater than the middle number of the array. 
# Return False if the number is less than the middle number of the array.
# If the array has an even amout of indexes you must decide how to handle that.

# Example Input: n = 4, array = [3,5,8, 10]
# Example Output: False
# Example Input: n = 105, array = [10,30,44,22,100]
# Example Output: True


#define a function that takes an input. the inputs aee aa list and an (n) numer
use the len dfunction to determine the length of the list 
#ength of input array 
#determine middle index
#divides with remainder
